    - 3 Main Components
        - Brain
            - Natural Language Interaction
                - Medium for communication
            - Knowledge
                - Linguistic, Commonsense, and Professional domain
            - Memory
                - Sequences of past observations, thoughts, and actions - retrieved for recency, relevance, and importance
            - Reasoning & Planning
                - Deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning types based on evidence and logic
                - Organizing, setting objectives, and determining steps via planning to achieve complex outcomes - with formulation and reflection
